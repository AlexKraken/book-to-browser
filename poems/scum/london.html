"LONDON.
A banquet.
Kings and queens grace the assembly.
People stuff their faces round the gilded pig -sty."

A curse on you!
May
savages,
eaters of human flesh,
from the colonies come scavenging
and feed on your royal heads.
May
rebellion's fire
flare over the kingdom.
May
your capitals
be burnt to ash.
May your heirs
and their kindred
be boiled in their crowns to mash.
