    <pre>To all
who are out on the streets
with bodies worn on the lathe,
To all
who dreamed holidays
with backs bent to the ground -
comrades, let us welcome
The first of May,
The first of Mays,
with voices joined
singing out loud.
Let spring wash the world's care away,
snow melt in the sun's shine.
I am a worker -
this is my May.
I am a peasant -
this May is mine.

To all
who lay down for murder
or escaped the trenches's cold clay,
To all
who on battleships
aimed guns
at your
brother tars -
celebrate
the first of May,
the first of Mays,
joining hands once divided by wars.
Machine guns, die away!
Silence, rifle bullets' whine!
I am a soldier -
this is my May.
I am a sailor -
this May is mine.
