# book-to-browser
This is a web browser interpretation of the artists' book "For the Voice," a collaboration between poet Vladamir Mayakovsky and artist El Lissitzky.

An early project of mine, it uses the CSS media query @media to distinguish between the desktop and mobile versions of the site. Using only CSS and HTML (no JavaScript), each version has unique animations meant to cater to the device displaying them.
